# EXPERIMENT - 9 - POINTERS IN C++

## Aim: To study and implement pointer concepts, pointer arithmetic, and memory management in C++.

## Apparatus: VS Code or Online C++ Compiler

## Theory:

**Pointers** are one of the most powerful and fundamental features in C++. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable rather than the actual value. Understanding pointers is crucial for efficient memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and creating sophisticated data structures.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Pointer Declaration**: A pointer is declared by placing an asterisk (*) before the variable name.
   ```cpp
   int* ptr;  // Declares a pointer to an integer
   ```

2. **Address-of Operator (&)**: Used to get the memory address of a variable.
   ```cpp
   int var = 10;
   int* ptr = &var;  // ptr now holds the address of var
   ```

3. **Dereference Operator (*)**: Used to access the value at the address stored in a pointer.
   ```cpp
   int value = *ptr;  // Gets the value stored at the address in ptr
   ```

4. **Pointer Arithmetic**: Pointers can be incremented or decremented. When a pointer is incremented, it moves to the next memory location based on the size of the data type it points to.

### Memory Layout and Data Type Sizes:
- **int**: Typically 4 bytes
- **float**: 4 bytes
- **double**: 8 bytes
- **char**: 1 byte
- **bool**: 1 byte

### Why Pointers Matter:
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Direct access to memory locations
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Creating variables at runtime
- **Data Structure Implementation**: Essential for linked lists, trees, graphs
- **Function Parameter Passing**: Passing large objects by reference
- **Array Manipulation**: Arrays and pointers have a close relationship

## Programs:

### 1. Basic Pointer Arithmetic

---

**Description:** Demonstrates pointer arithmetic with different data types, showing how pointer increment operations depend on the size of the data type being pointed to.

**Algorithm:**
1. Declare variables of different data types (int, float, double, char, bool)
2. Create pointers for each variable and assign their addresses
3. Display the original address of each pointer
4. Display the size of each data type
5. Increment each pointer by 1
6. Display the new address after increment
7. Observe how the address changes based on data type size

**Sample Output:**
```
The original address of the int is: 0x7ffdcda63224
The size of an int is: 4 bytes
The address of int after increment is: 0x7ffdcda63228

The original address of the float is: 0x7ffdcda63220
The size of a float is: 4 bytes
The address of float after increment is: 0x7ffdcda63224

The original address of the double is: 0x7ffdcda63218
The size of a double is: 8 bytes
The address of double after increment is: 0x7ffdcda63220

The original address of the char is: 0x7ffdcda63217
The size of a char is: 1 bytes
The address of char after increment is: 0x7ffdcda63218

The original address of the bool is: 0x7ffdcda63216
The size of a bool is: 1 bytes
The address of bool after increment is: 0x7ffdcda63217
```

### 2. Difference Between Two Pointers

---

**Description:** Calculates the difference between values pointed to by two different pointers in an array.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create an integer array with sample values
2. Create two pointers pointing to different elements in the array
3. Calculate the difference between the values at these pointer locations
4. Display the result

**Sample Output:**
```
Difference is : -20
```

### 3. Traversing Array Using Pointers

---

**Description:** Demonstrates how to traverse an array using pointer arithmetic, displaying both addresses and values of array elements.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create an integer array with sample values
2. Initialize a pointer to point to the first element of the array
3. Use a loop to iterate through all array elements
4. For each element, display both its memory address and value
5. Increment the pointer to move to the next element

**Sample Output:**
```
Address of element 1 is 0x7fff35124830
Value of element 1 is 10
Address of element 2 is 0x7fff35124834
Value of element 2 is 20
Address of element 3 is 0x7fff35124838
Value of element 3 is 30
Address of element 4 is 0x7fff3512483c
Value of element 4 is 40
Address of element 5 is 0x7fff35124840
Value of element 5 is 50
```

### 4. String Manipulation Using Pointers

---

**Description:** Shows how to traverse and display a string character by character using pointer arithmetic.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create a character array (string) with sample text
2. Initialize a character pointer to point to the first character
3. Use a while loop to iterate through the string until null terminator is reached
4. Display each character using pointer dereferencing
5. Increment the pointer to move to the next character

**Sample Output:**
```
Hi! How are you
```
